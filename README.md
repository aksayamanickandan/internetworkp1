### Shivani Adusumilli, Sanjida Islam, Aksaya Manickandan, Jose Sanchez, Michael Walelign

#### Tasks
#### - Develop a program that (a) identifies key words in text strings, (b) convert the key words into numerical values
#### - Generate simple examples to test your program
#### - Then test on real data


### What our Code Does
#### This program extracts keywords(names of foods and drinks) from different statements. The program then assigns values to the keywords according to this rule
####  - Foods for breakfast - close to 1
####  - Drinks - close to 2
####  - Foods for dinner - close to 3
####  - The output of the program is a string array(kw) containing keywords and a vector of values(vals) that correspond to the key words. ####  - A plot shows the distribution of keywords
