### Shivani Adusumilli, Sanjida Islam, Aksaya Manickandan, Jose Sanchez, Michael Walelign

### Tasks
#### - Develop a program that (a) identifies key words in text strings, (b) convert the key words into numerical values
#### - Generate simple examples to test your program
#### - Then test on real data


### What our Code Does
#### This program extracts keywords(names of foods and drinks) from different statements. The program then assigns values to the keywords according to this rule:
####  - Foods for breakfast - close to 1
####  - Drinks - close to 2
####  - Foods for dinner - close to 3
#### The output of the program is two string arrays containing keywords It detects "want" , "ate"... in addition to "like".  It's tested with a different sentence to account for that
